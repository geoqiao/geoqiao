# Welcome to my GitHub page!

This repository documents my journey of learning Python and data analysis. As an ordinary graduate with a background in business studies, I went from knowing nothing about vlookup to becoming proficient in Excel, and then ventured into learning SQL and Python to tackle data analysis tasks. Through this repository, I aim to record/share my learning experiences and help others in their journey of learning Python and data analysis.

# The plan for this GitHub page is as follows:

1. **Study Notes and Tutorials**: Create a folder to store my study notes and tutorials on learning Python and data analysis. These resources will cover fundamental concepts, syntax, common issues, and solutions.

2. **Code Examples**: Establish a folder for code examples showcasing Python scripts and snippets I have written during my learning journey. These examples will encompass practical applications in data processing, data visualization, machine learning, and more.

3. **Useful Tools and Scripts**: Create a folder to collect and share useful Python tools and scripts that streamline data analysis and processing tasks. These tools may involve Excel automation, data cleaning, data scraping, and other relevant areas.

4. **Problem Solving and Discussions**: Set up a section for problem-solving and discussions, encouraging others to ask questions related to learning Python and data analysis and share experiences and solutions.

5. **Resource Recommendations**: Build a resource recommendation page, including recommendations for high-quality learning resources, tutorials, books, and online courses that I have found valuable during my journey of learning Python and data analysis.

6. **English Support**: Add English language support to the repository, including README, documentation, and code comments, to attract an international audience and provide a wider range of learning resources.

7. **Contributions and Collaboration**: Encourage others to contribute to the repository, whether it's providing improvement suggestions, submitting code examples, or sharing their own learning experiences. Through collaboration, we can collectively drive the development and growth of this repository.

These plans will help me organize and share my experiences and resources in learning Python and data analysis in a systematic manner. Through continuous updates and improvements, I hope this repository becomes a valuable learning resource, providing assistance to others in their learning and career development.
